# Bus_details

I have understood the question as follows,

- connect to aws and start a notebook
 I have connected using my AWS account and created Sagemaker notebook then created the Instances of Notebook
- load and show the attached datafile in AWS notebook
Loaded the Data into the notebook using Sagemaker Jupyter Notebook file name is bus_details.csv
- clean the dataset if necessary, we need to export a CSV file comma ',' separated file, the headers must be translated into english (use google translate)
Translated only headers into English,separated the file using comma(,) and changed the header beautification.
- which line have the most bus travelling ? 
I have fetched the row which has the highest value in the Line_id column.
- which destinations have "Saint" in the name ?
I have fetched all the data which contains "Saint" word init.
- which is the nearest bus from the eiffel tower based on provided coordinates ? 
I have tried to find out eiffel tower in the following data file but I am not able to find out.I may miss understood the question or I dont know I am confuse.:(

I hope have understood the questions correctly if not then I am ready to rework.


Thank you :)
